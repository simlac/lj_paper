This paper studies growth of communities in LiveJournal which is  an online social network that has 
user-defined communities. The primary goal of this work is to find features of communities that affect their growth in the future.  We studied about $2000$ communities  inside LiveJournal, and collected data from them in 7 snapshots spanned in a period of five months.  That is for each community at each snapshot, we recorded its members and their friends lists inside LiveJournal.

For each member of a community, we define the notion of  \emph{attractiveness}, which reflects how successful she has been in attracting her friends to join the community. We find that the percentage of attractive members of a community in a short time interval, has a strong correlation with its growth rate in the future. We also tried to measure the correlation between the growth and some structural properties of the communities such as  clustering coefficient and average degree. None of them showed a similar evidence of strong correlation.
